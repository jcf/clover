# Clover

A Leiningen template for rapid deployment of a Clojure-based web application.

Highlights include:

- Clojure server-side
- [Reagent][] and [Clojurescript][] client-side
- Efficient asset delivery via [Optimus][]
- Live code reloading via [Figwheel][]
- REPL-driven development with [component][] and [reloaded.repl][]
- Browser-based REPL via [Weasel][] and [Piggieback][]
- [clojure.test][] and [clojurescript.test][]
- Uberjar deployment

## Installation

Via Clojars as always.

## Roadmap

There are a number of additional features either in use in other applications or
planned that we will be adding to this template in the future. Some of these
features are as follows.

**Actively being considered:**

- Add clj-webdriver for browser-based acceptance testing
- Add improved CSS/SASS support

**Maybe:**

- Add out-of-the-box support for Travis CI
- Add out-of-the-box support for Heroku
